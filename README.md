# AI-Powered-Financial-Fraud-Detection-System
An AI-powered financial fraud detection system using K-Means, Isolation Forest, Random Forest, LightGBM, and SHAP Explainability with an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## 📌 Overview

Financial fraud has become one of the biggest challenges in the banking and fintech industry. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect evolving fraud patterns, resulting in financial losses and reduced customer trust.
This project presents an **AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection System** that combines **supervised learning**, **unsupervised anomaly detection**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while providing interpretable predictions through an interactive **Streamlit** web application.
The system performs transaction analysis, fraud classification, anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and risk assessment using multiple machine learning models.
